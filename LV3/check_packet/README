check.cpp:
  used to check the simu packets generated by OFC1_v99, where the simu data from 16 ADCs are exactly the same, i.e., they have the same size and they follow the same beam structure

check_vary.cpp:
  used to check the simu packets generated by OFC1_v92, where the simu data from each ADC is different from the others. They follow beam structures from different spills and they have different size foreach event. Each ADC will generate its own simu energy, the size of which follows a distinct arithmetic sequence.
